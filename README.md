# COVID-19-LSTM-model
Implementing a LSTM model (recurrent neural network (RNN)) in order to predict the number of COVID-19 ICU patients in Italy.
The aiming of this project was to link the vaccinations data with the number of ICU patients (solely COVID-19 patients)
and the test positivity ratio (positive tests/total tests) in order to predict the number of COVID-19 ICU patients of the next day.
Features set:
- Pfizer/BioNTech total doses.
- Moderna total doses.
- Oxford/AstraZeneca total doses.
- Johnson&Johnson.
- Daily ICU occupancy (COVID-19 patients).
- short_term_positivity_ratio.
